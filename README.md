# Vue 3 (CLI) + Vuex + Auto Routing + Auto Imports boilerplate

This is a minimal boilerplate for Vue 3 (CLI). It comes with Vuex and Vue Router along with my favourite featues from Nuxt, auto imported components and auto generated routes. It also has jest configured. Just install and get to work. ðŸš€

### Tools used for automations

[vue-cli-plugin-import-components](https://github.com/harlan-zw/vue-cli-plugin-import-components) For components |
[vue-cli-plugin-auto-routings](https://github.com/ktsn/vue-cli-plugin-auto-routing) For routing

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000

# build for production
$ npm run build
```
